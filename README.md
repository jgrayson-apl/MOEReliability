# ACS Summary Statistics with Margin of Error

This app helps people aggregate estimates from the most current release of the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year data by summing up tracts. Survey estimates contain error due to sampling, and the margins of error are worth reporting when exploring ACS data. Aggregating tracts together can help resolve concerns about the reliability of the estimates.
